## Summary

Increase OP_RETURN size limit to 256 bytes.

## Conventions
- The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

## Motivation

We want to increase adoption of our blockchain, allowing more data to be stored on the blockchain without polluting utxo table is good opportunity.

## Detailed design

A simple parameter change.

## Drawbacks

Blockchain size may increase.

## Alternatives

We could remove OP_RETURN size altogether as long as appropriate fee is paid.

## Unresolved questions

What parts of the design are still to be done?
